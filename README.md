EasySlidingMenu
===============

a simple example for slidingmenu ,you don't need to depend on actionbarsherlock;
in github there have a famous open source android library named SlidingMenu.
if you want to konw  link here : https://github.com/jfeinstein10/SlidingMenu

if you want to use SlidingMenu,you must get actionbarsherlock first.
i konw some developers may only use a little function, they feel the slidingMenu is too big;

if you were one of these developers you can use EasySlidingMenu;

I use 3 java file from slidingMenu: CustomViewAbove.java,CustomViewBehind.java SlidingMenu.java
these 3 java file are necessary, and the forth file SimpleListFragment.java, your can replace this file with your own
Fragment;

Thanks for  SlidingMenu 's author Jeremy Feinstein .
